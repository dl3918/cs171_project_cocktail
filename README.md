# All About Cocktails

###### Final Project for CS 171 (Data Visualization Class at Harvard)
Dataset: Cocktail Data
<br/> Team Members: April Chang, Danni Lai, Haitian Liu

###### Motivation:
Cocktails have a special allure. While many savor their unique tastes, not everyone knows the craftsmanship behind them. Our mission is more than just enjoying these drinks; it's about understanding their creation. We aim to take enthusiasts on a journey, revealing the blend of art and science that is mixology.

###### Objective:
Our primary objective is to design an interactive data story that allows users to explore the vast array of cocktails, discover their ingredients, and visualize the relationship between different cocktails based on shared components. We aim to:
Display the varying ingredients and their proportions in popular cocktails.
Highlight the origins, history, and cultural significance of selected beverages.
Offer a user-friendly interface where individuals can explore and learn about cocktails.
